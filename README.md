## Configuration

### How to get the TOKEN

Press F12 or enter developer mode
now CLICK ON ** NETWORK **
CLICK on ** Fetch/XHR **
Refresh the page by clicking F5
Wait for it to update as soon as ** get ** appears. Look for ** Authorization **

Copy everything except ** BEARER ** at the beginning we won't use it
Now just paste it into the ** token.txt ** folder on your computer

### Token Setup

There are two ways to set up your VapeLabs tokens:

#### Option 1: Using tokens.txt file (Recommended)

Create a `tokens.txt` file in the root directory and add one token per line:

```
token1_here
token2_here
token3_here
```

### Proxy Setup (Optional)

Create a `proxies.txt` file in the root directory and add one proxy per line in the format `ip:port` or `ip:port:username:password`:

```
http://123.45.67.89:8080
http://username:password@ip:port
```

## Usage

The bot features an interactive terminal UI:

- Use **Arrow Keys** (‚Üê ‚Üí) to navigate between accounts
- Press **Q** to quit the bot

### Battery Tapping Logic

- When battery is **below 50%**, the bot will automatically tap (5 taps every 20 seconds) until it reaches 100%
- When battery is **100%**, the bot will wait until it drops below 50% to start tapping again
- When battery is **between 50% and 100%**, the bot will wait until it drops below 50%

## Troubleshooting

- If you're experiencing rate limiting (429 errors), consider:
  - Adding more proxies to `proxies.txt`
  - Increasing the delay between requests
