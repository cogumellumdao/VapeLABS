Node.js: Version 16 or higher (tested with v22.14.0). Download Node.js.

npm install


Configure Tokens:Set up your TheVapeLabs tokens (obtained from the platform) using one of the following methods:
Option 1: Using tokens.txt (Recommended)
Create a tokens.txt file in the root directory and add one token per line:
token1_here
token2_here
token3_here


Configure Proxies (Optional):To avoid rate limiting, create a proxies.txt file in the root directory and add one proxy per line in the format ip:port or ip:port:username:password:
http://123.45.67.89:8080
http://username:password@ip:port


Run the Bot:Start the bot with:
node index.js



Usage
The bot launches an interactive terminal interface with the following components:

Fixed Banner: A stylized ASCII art banner at the top.
Status Panel: Displays uptime, number of accounts loaded, total taps, and successful taps.
User Info Panel: Shows account ID, username, points, and battery level.
Tapping Status Panel: Displays proxy, tapping status, battery level, and time left.
Log Panel: Scrollable logs with real-time updates and status icons (‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for errors, etc.).
Instructions Panel: Guides navigation and exit commands.

Battery Tapping Logic

Below 50%: Auto-taps (5 taps every 20 seconds) until 100%.
100%: Stops tapping and waits until battery drops below 50%.
50% to 99%: Waits until battery drops below 50% before resuming tapping.

Troubleshooting

Syntax Errors: Ensure the index.js file is not corrupted. Use the provided code if errors occur.
No Tokens Found: Verify that tokens.txt or .env contains valid tokens.
Rate Limiting (429 Errors):
Add more proxies to proxies.txt.
Increase delays in index.js (e.g., adjust setTimeout in performTapBurst).


Interface Issues: Use a terminal that supports ANSI colors and resizing (e.g., Windows Terminal).
API Errors: Check token validity or API URL (https://api.thevapelabs.net/v1.0).
